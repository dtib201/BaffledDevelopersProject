## IT6037 Project

We are a working group that develops digital resources for school students. We have been asked to develop a database and later implement it as a source of information to develop a mobile or web application.  
The database is to contain reference materials for students on three subjects: art, mathematics and technology. Each subject could have articles with biographies of the key people as well as articles on the major art objects, events and important concepts.  


The database can be accessed by administrators, tutors and students with various access levels. 

The client would like the database to have the following functionality:  


**Students should be able to:** 

- *Browse articles by category*
- *Browse articles by a keyword in the title*


**Tutors should be able to:**

- *Add or modify articles*


**Administrators should be able to:**

- *Add, modify or remove articles*



As a team, we have decided to use the Agile approach and develop in iterations with the client's approval at the end of each iteration. After a discussion with the client, the following iterations have been agreed upon: 

- For the database we have decided as a group to use MongoDB. 
- For the backend of the application, we have decided to use Strappi.IO 
- For the single page front end of the application, we decided to use React.
